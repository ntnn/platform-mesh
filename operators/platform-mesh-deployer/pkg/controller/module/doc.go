// Package module deploys one Module onto the clusters engaged for its
// PlatformMesh.
//
// A pass runs as a chain, each step the prerequisite of the next:
//
//  1. Load the Module. A deleted one goes down the finalize path instead: its
//     objects are pruned from every cluster the PlatformMesh has engaged,
//     deliberately wider than the module's last known placement, and only then
//     is the finalizer dropped.
//  2. Validate the spec and reject dependency cycles. Both are terminal: only
//     an edit can fix them, and that re-triggers the watch, so they are
//     recorded on the status rather than retried.
//  3. Wait for the PlatformMesh, for a post-topology module. A pre-topology
//     module skips this, since the topology is what waits for it.
//  4. Wait for the modules in spec.dependsOn to be ready.
//  5. Resolve the component version and record its digest.
//  6. Fan the components out over the engaged clusters.
//  7. Write the ModuleSetup handshake and wait for the provisioner to finish
//     the kcp side, so the payload can rely on its workspaces existing.
//  8. Mint the kubeconfigs and certificates each instance needs, render the
//     payload and apply it, then prune what no longer belongs.
//
// Ready is written last and aggregates the chain. The PlatformMesh's
// pre-topology gate and other modules' dependency gates read it.
