// Package platformmesh brings up the kcp installation a PlatformMesh
// describes, on the clusters engaged for it.
//
// A pass runs as a chain, each step the prerequisite of the next:
//
//  1. Wait for the modules that have to exist before kcp — the etcd the shards
//     store into, for one. Modules are watched, so this waits without polling.
//  2. Render the kcp-operator admin CRs for the root shard, the shards, the
//     front proxy, the cache server and the virtual workspaces, deleting the
//     ones no longer wanted. Every unmet precondition here is an error rather
//     than a wait: no engaged root shard cluster means the installation is
//     misconfigured, not that it is still starting.
//  3. Publish those components through the configured ingress stacks, writing
//     routes on the workload clusters.
//  4. Create the kcp workspaces everything else is installed below. Only runs
//     where this deployer also runs the provisioner; kcp is a separate API
//     server and is not watched, so waiting on it polls.
//  5. Roll the resolved version up onto the status.
//
// Ready is written last and aggregates the chain. The module controller gates
// its post-topology modules on it, and the e2e suite waits on it.
