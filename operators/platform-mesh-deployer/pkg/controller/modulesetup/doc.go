// Package modulesetup performs the kcp side of a module. It is the only part
// of the deployer that writes inside kcp.
//
// A pass runs as a chain:
//
//  1. Load the ModuleSetup. A deleted one goes down the finalize path instead:
//     its workspaces are removed deepest first, so a parent never outlives a
//     child, and only then is the finalizer dropped.
//  2. Fetch the PlatformMesh the setup belongs to and wait until its root
//     structure exists — the module's workspaces are created below it. The
//     PlatformMesh is watched, so this waits without polling.
//  3. Mint and read the kcp admin kubeconfig. kcp-operator writes the secret
//     asynchronously and nothing watches it, so this one polls.
//  4. Create each declared workspace along its path and apply the content the
//     module ships for it, downloaded from the module's component version.
//     A workspace that is not schedulable yet also polls.
//  5. Publish each workspace's URL on the status, so the module's payload can
//     address its own workspaces without knowing how the front proxy is
//     exposed.
//
// Ready is the handshake the module controller waits on before it deploys the
// workloads that talk to these workspaces.
